check out the outline and the example project code ni have the example projhect is a telegram relay for claude code cli it gets the json stream and does magic. im wondering if we could actually repurpose this setup to apply for a bot instead absically we would make a bot do u remembver "smarterchild" back in the day. anyone could msg the bot and interact with it...so i am imagine a service where we build a "brain" for the bot thats like a system prompt that gets passed with the msgs and anyone can msg it and  literally on the backend we're using claude as the backend service but out custom system prompt brain is giving it a certain personality and very curated output style.... we could literally have multiple brain files and multiple bots all under one projects here...... and we'd need a system to like manage it.. sometiung like ability to set ohh u can msg back and fortth for 5-10 msgs then u can sign up for access(or pay$$ or somelthing later toonetize)    so we'd need like that auth backend to manage all that. the current example up is very simple u just msg it and then manually add sessions. we'd need the whole more complex backend for out own auth.

then  basically we could have a system wqhere we can 1. run multiple tg bots off of esseniually one project (would we need multiple nodes running? 
 we need to figure the intricate stuff liek this all out),...... we could even load balance since claude code is subscription and time limit rate lkimit based we could load balance accounts to serve the bots usage all thru subscription cli oath NOT API..... 

this project is a 

1. unqiue business opportunity to manage bots at scale and payment struicture to monetize usage (we'll have to figure out payments)

2. on top of using this for ourselves for option 1 we can also offer this platform as a basically bot managemnt platform as a service. thoughts?



let me know what u think about everyting here. interesting idea? would u be hyped to do this project with me? does it seem overly ambitious? the telecode example is proof of conecept the relay is very straight forward. we'd essentially be building a bot backend system for bot-as-service....whether it be the platform or even the individual company who wants one bot could use out platform. thoughts?
